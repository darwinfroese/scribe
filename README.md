# Scribe

Scribe is a local-only project management tool built for managing multiple projects.

> Scribe is currently in active development.

## Features
- Simple JSON database local to the project, or globally across the system enabling generic tasks and project specific tasks to be managed.
- Plan tasks for a "session" to scope a subset of tasks as a goal for the day (completed tasks are automatically assigned to the session).
- Write session notes to summarize what was done during the session to refresh when picking up a project days, weeks, or months later.
- Generate reports that summarize previous sessions to catch up before picking up a project again.
